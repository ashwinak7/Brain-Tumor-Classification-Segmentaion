# Visualization on Flask

To create an interactive and user-friendly experience, a Flask-based web interface was developed to visualize outputs of both classification and segmentation models. Users can upload MRI images through the interface and view real-time output predictions, such as tumor type classification and segmented tumor regions. The integration of trained deep learning models with Flask ensures smooth deployment and allows end-users, such as medical professionals or researchers, to access results without requiring technical knowledge. This web application effectively bridges the gap between model development and practical usage, providing clear visual feedback for each prediction.

## üñ•Ô∏è Flask Interface Overview

The Flask-based web interface provides an intuitive platform for real-time brain tumor detection. It supports multiple deep learning models, including **ResNet50** and **Hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT)** for tumor classification. Users can easily select a model, upload MRI scans, and receive instant predictions with high-confidence scores.

- **Glioma Detection** (99.98% confidence using ResNet50)
- **Meningioma Classification** (99.81% confidence via Hybrid ViT)

In addition to classification, the interface also provides segmented tumor regions, allowing users to see spatial localization and demarcation of tumor boundaries for improved diagnostic clarity.

The system was designed to be **user-friendly**, removing entry barriers for non-technical users and embedding the trained models in an accessible web-based environment. This facilitates user interaction and provides real-time feedback, making it easier for medical professionals to leverage the power of AI in their diagnostic process.
