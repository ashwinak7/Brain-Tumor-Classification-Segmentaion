**ResNet50 Metrics**

| Class       | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Glioma      | 0.97      | 0.99   | 0.98     | 310     |
| Meningioma  | 0.97      | 0.94   | 0.96     | 326     |
| No Tumor    | 1.00      | 0.99   | 0.99     | 419     |
| Pituitary   | 0.96      | 0.99   | 0.98     | 350     |

- **Overall Accuracy**: 0.97  
- **Dice Score**: 0.96

The model achieved an overall accuracy of **97%** and a Dice Score of **0.96**, indicating a high level of confidence in distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor cases. 

- Glioma and Pituitary classes showed high precision (0.97 and 0.96) and recall (0.99 for both), producing an F1-score of 0.98.
- No Tumor cases achieved **perfect precision (1.00)** and **recall (0.99)**, representing the model‚Äôs excellent ability to identify healthy scans.
- Meningioma had slightly lower recall (0.94), leading to an F1-score of 0.96, possibly due to similarity with other tumor types.

## ‚úÖ Summary

The ResNet50 model provides balanced and high classification performance across brain tumor types, particularly for Glioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor classes. Slight inconsistencies for Meningioma classification may be improved with further data augmentation or attention-based refinements. These results support ResNet50‚Äôs strength in MRI-based tumor classification tasks.
