| Glioma      | 0.9733    | 0.8500 | 0.9075   | 300     |
| Meningioma  | 0.8620    | 0.9183 | 0.8892   | 306     |
| No Tumor    | 0.9711    | 0.9951 | 0.9829   | 405     |
| Pituitary   | 0.9545    | 0.9800 | 0.9671   | 300     |

- **Overall Accuracy**: 0.9904  
- **Dice Score**: 0.94

---

Hybrid Vision Transformer achieved an **overall accuracy of 99.04%** and a **Dice Score of 0.94**, indicating excellent performance in distinguishing tumor vs. non-tumor brain MRI scans.

- **No Tumor cases**: Precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.99 with an F1 score of 0.98. The model excelled in correctly identifying healthy brain scans, minimizing false positives.
- **Pituitary tumors**: Precision of 0.95 and recall of 0.98 resulted in a strong F1 score of 0.97, showcasing reliability in detecting this class.
- **Glioma**: High precision (0.97) but relatively lower recall (0.85), resulting in an F1-score of 0.91 ‚Äì suggesting some false negatives where gliomas were misclassified.
- **Meningioma**: Lower precision (0.86) and higher recall (0.92) led to an F1-score of 0.89. This highlights the model's tendency to prioritize sensitivity (minimizing missed tumors) at the cost of a few false positives.

These findings emphasize the model's effectiveness and its balance between precision and recall, especially for complex or visually similar tumor types.
